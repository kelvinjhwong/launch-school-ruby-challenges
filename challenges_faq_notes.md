# The 4 steps for writing code

1. 1st draft: understanding the problem
2. 2nd draft: re-thinking the problem + refactoring
3. 3rd draft: reading other people's code, brainstorming with others
4. 4th draft: analysing for performance bottlenecks

# Advice on completing 1st draft

1. Prioritise step 1! If we skimp on this step, we pay for it
   in time wasted on unncessary re-writes
2. Don't optimise prematurely - just focus on getting to a
   solution first. Refactoring a full solution is far more
   efficient, than refactoring halfway through
3. Don't write too much pseudocode without running actual
   code to verify my algorithm
4. Don't be afraid to start over - if I want to keep some
   code while trying out something new, just comment it out,
   or save it elsewhere; don't hope to hack and slash my way
   through
